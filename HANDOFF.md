# Plenara — Session Handoff (pick up here)

_Last updated: 2026-07-07. Written to survive a Claude process relaunch._

## TL;DR — where we are

The **v0 engine is complete and heavily tested**; the **Windows desktop app is
dogfood-ready** (runs on a user-chosen synced folder + BYOK key). Latest session
shipped **F2 reminders**, the **people loop** (Fable #3), **on-open nudges** (Fable
#4), and a **Fable strategic review → Phase 1 typed `CloudResult` refactor**. The
cloud seam now returns typed results (Ok/abstain vs named CloudError kinds); Session
surfaces honest failure reasons + logs cloud health per turn; cloud date/datetime
slots are normalized (no midnight/dropped reminders); the machine-specific `.env`
fallback is gone from the app path. **Fable Phase 2 is DONE too** — discoverability
("what can you do"), a turnlog report, and partial-name matching with a disambiguation
clarify ("Sam" → "Sam Rivera", or a "which one?" question). Then went DEEP on Phase-5
capability: relationship queries (both directions), forget-fact (+ a `contains` cond),
a due-tasks agenda, recall-mood, reschedule-reminder/task (snooze), and
remember-relationship (offline "X is Y's Z"). Fixed real bugs found along the way —
retrieval hermeticity, a **reconcile time-change bug** (a rescheduled reminder kept
its old toast), and the flagship "remember that Mia is Sarah's daughter" being
cloud-only. De-flaked the authoring fixtures (recorder + schema-drift test now drive
the real Session validate→retry loop), then started the spec-conformance program (below).
**HEAD = `f9e2695`**, working tree clean (ignore the pre-existing dirty
`planning/specs/05a-rig/results/embed-v0.log` + untracked `.claude/settings.local.json`),
**1248 Dart tests + 8 Flutter widget tests green** (31 skills, 9 types; DSL now has
ordering/limit/filter-ops + aggregation/date-math; ProvideSlot slot-filling; alias
resolution), `dart analyze` clean,
**`flutter build windows --debug` succeeds**. `DOGFOOD.md` refreshed for tonight.

**Working-mode enforcement (new):** a user-level **Stop hook**
(`~/.claude/hooks/stop-guard.ps1` + `~/.claude/settings.json`) bounces any turn whose
final ~160 chars are a permission-seeking coda ("want me to…/should I…"), so work
continues while unblocked items remain. Fails open. If you (a future session) get a
"STOP BLOCKED (working-mode hook)" message, that's it — pick the next unblocked item and
do it, don't re-ask. The rule itself is in `CLAUDE.md` "Working mode" (rewritten `627d4cc`).

**The immediate next task: the SPEC-CONFORMANCE PROGRAM (the real remaining scope).**
A full spec-vs-code audit (5 forks, synthesized) found the engine *spine* is done but
the app satisfies only ~1 of the 60 05a examples cleanly, ~12 partially, ~47 fail —
four whole architecture components (Automation, Generative, SchemaRegistry/Migration,
ContentSearch) and the conversational NLU seams (slot-fill, alias, anaphora, OOD) are
unbuilt, and the DSL was thinner than the spec's own §9.2 seed skills. This is weeks of
build, NOT "mostly done." **Ranked top-10 (see "Spec-conformance program" section):**
1 DSL query+compute fidelity ✅ DONE (`8cc36ed`); 2 ProvideSlot slot-filling dialogue
✅ DONE (`619f07c`); 3 tracker templates + free instantiate (§12.4 G-22) — free→paid
misroute slice ✅ DONE (`f9e2695`, built-in recognizer); instantiating NEW built-in
types from a template library REMAINS; 4 alias/role/group person resolution ✅ DONE
(`f3a396f`); **5 correction robustness update-vs-reverse (§3.3 F-14/15) ← NEXT**; 6
GenerativeService + gift_ideas/briefing (§3.10); 7 authoring preview→refine→activate +
reconcile + pin Opus + structured output (§6 G-18/29); 8 recurrence RRULE + record-anchored
dates (§6.2 G-14/15); 9 safety Layer-2/3 + record-integrity (§7.6 G-30 DP-05); 10
records-vs-OOD boundary (§7.2 G-19). Work them in order; each is a committed increment.
Also-done this session: all 3 correctness defects (`c29732c` safety-bypass + format-leak,
`f9e2695` free→paid), journaling/F-11, streaks/G-21, total-distance (aggregation demo).
(Blocked/deferred, do NOT pick: native toast/ATL, voice, CRDT merge engine, persisted
journal, presentation archetypes, at-rest encryption, per-device corpus.)

**One blocker for Luis (needs admin):** the native Windows toast for reminders
needs the **ATL** VS Build Tools component (`atlbase.h`), which requires an admin
install. Everything else about reminders is done + tested against a fake scheduler;
only the real toast render is gated. Command is in "Deferred / open".

**Environment note (new machine/user `luism`):** re-established this session — git
`safe.directory` exceptions added, `luisma-code` PAT re-stored in GCM (headless
push verified), `dart pub get` re-run for both `v0/` and `app/`. Windows Dev Mode
is ON (registry-verified).

## Two standing directives from Luis (most important context)

1. **Automated tests must provide real product-level validation.** Anything whose
   only validation is manual dogfooding *will* regress. Every OS-facing capability
   ships **behind a thin adapter interface with a fake**, so the *logic* is
   CI-tested deterministically and only a razor-thin "call the real OS API" shim
   needs a one-time human smoke. (Same pattern as `StorageRepository` /
   `CloudClient`.) This is the governing principle for all new work.
2. **Work autonomously, never ask permission** (see `CLAUDE.md` working-mode). Decide,
   record rationale, commit, keep going. Review happens when the work is done.

## How to run / verify (toolchain is local, gitignored)

- Dart SDK: `Z:/code/plenara/.tools/dart-sdk/bin/dart.exe`
- Flutter: `Z:/code/plenara/.tools/flutter/bin/flutter.bat` (3.44.5, accepts VS Build Tools 2019)
- Tests: `cd v0 && Z:/code/plenara/.tools/dart-sdk/bin/dart.exe test` (1019, hermetic)
- Analyze: `<dart> analyze lib bin test` (from `v0/`)
- App: `cd app && <flutter> test` (widget) / `<flutter> build windows --debug` → `app/build/windows/x64/runner/Debug/plenara_app.exe`
- Cloud fixtures (only if `lib/fixture_inputs.dart` changes): `cd v0 && <dart> run bin/record_fixtures.dart` (one BYOK Haiku pass, commit the cassette)
- Optional embed server for retrieval: llama-server w/ bge-small on `:8091` (graceful if absent)

**Before every commit:** `git grep --cached -nE "sk-ant-[A-Za-z0-9]{20}"` must be 0.
Commit trailers required (Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) + Claude-Session)
— see `CLAUDE.md`. Line-ending (CRLF) warnings on commit are benign.

## Fresh machine / new user context — environment setup

The Claude auto-memory does NOT transfer across OS users/machines (it lives in
`C:\Users\<you>\.claude\…`). This doc + `CLAUDE.md` are in the repo and are all
you need. **First:** tell the new Claude *"read HANDOFF.md and CLAUDE.md, then
continue."* Then, if it's a fresh clone / different user, re-establish these
(all gitignored, so they don't come with the repo):

1. **Toolchain into `Z:\code\plenara\.tools\` (~2 GB, gitignored).**
   - **Flutter** (bundles the matching Dart): download `flutter_windows_<ver>-stable.zip`
     from flutter.dev's release archive (we used **3.44.5**; latest stable is fine),
     unzip to `.tools\flutter`. First `flutter\bin\flutter.bat --version` builds the tool.
   - **Dart SDK** used by the v0 commands is a standalone at `.tools\dart-sdk\`
     (**3.12.2**, from dart.dev's archive). Alternatively just use Flutter's bundled
     Dart at `.tools\flutter\bin\dart.bat` and adjust the commands.
2. **Windows build prereq:** Visual Studio **Build Tools 2019+ with "Desktop
   development with C++"** (2019 confirmed working; 2022 fine). `flutter doctor`
   verifies it. Native plugins (notifications, voice) also need **Windows Developer
   Mode ON** (Settings → For developers).
3. **API key.** The key pasted early on is **exposed — ROTATE it** at
   console.anthropic.com. Then provide the new one by ONE of: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   env var; `planning\specs\05a-rig\.env` as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-…` (gitignored,
   for tests/recorder); or `~/.plenara/config.json` `"apiKey"` (for the app).
4. **Permissions.** To match this session's autonomous flow, set the new user's
   `~/.claude/settings.json` `permissions.defaultMode` to `bypassPermissions` (or
   just approve interactively). This is a per-user setting, not in the repo.
5. **Optional:** the retrieval embed server (llama-server + bge-small on `:8091`)
   — everything degrades gracefully without it.

Same machine, different user? Simplest is to copy
`C:\Users\lmh10\.claude\projects\Z--code-plenara\` into the new user's
`.claude\projects\` — but it's optional; the in-repo docs cover everything.

## Transferring the repo + credentials to the new context

**Repo state: RESOLVED — origin is current.** `origin` =
`github.com/luisma-code/plenara.git` (public). All work is pushed;
`origin/main` == local `main`. Push auth was initially denied (this session
commits as GitHub user `cognivita-ai`, which lacks write access to
`luisma-code/plenara`); resolved by storing a **`luisma-code` PAT** in the OS
credential store (Git Credential Manager). Config set for headless push (global): `credential.credentialStore=dpapi` (a
Windows store GCM can persist to + read back without a GUI),
`credential.interactive=false`, `credential.guiPrompt=false`. Verified: `git
credential fill` returns the stored token non-interactively, so **plain `git push
origin main` works headlessly** — no token in any command needed anymore.

> **⚠ ROTATE the PAT.** The token was transmitted in chat → treat it as
> compromised. Generate a new fine-grained PAT (Contents: Read+Write on plenara)
> and re-store it: `printf 'protocol=https\nhost=github.com\nusername=luisma-code\npassword=<NEW>\n\n' | git credential approve`. The remote URL is token-free (verified); the token lives only in GCM, never in the repo/bundle.

- **Credential-free fallback bundle:** **`Z:\code\plenara.bundle`** has the full
  history (verified clonable, scanned clean) for moving to a machine without git
  creds — `git clone plenara.bundle plenara`. Regenerate: `git bundle create ../plenara.bundle --all`.

**Two different "Claude keys" — don't conflate:**
1. **Claude Code auth** (to RUN Claude as the new user): the new user signs in with
   their OWN Claude login / subscription (or configures their own Claude Code API key).
   Not transferable by tooling — it's per-user account auth.
2. **Anthropic BYOK key** (the app's own API calls — routing, authoring, the fixture
   recorder): rotate the exposed one, then supply via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env /
   `planning\specs\05a-rig\.env` / `~/.plenara/config.json` (see setup above).

**Security:** move every credential (GitHub PAT, the BYOK key) **out-of-band** — a
password manager or a secure channel — **never in the repo, a commit, or the bundle.**
The bundle is intentionally secret-free; keep it that way.

## What's built (the code)

**`v0/lib/` — the engine (~pure Dart, ~1,600 lines):**
- `interpreter.dart` — Skill interpreter. Two-phase resolve→execute. **All 10 DSL
  ops** (read_one, read_many, read_related, write_record [create + update via
  `target`], delete_record [tombstone], compute, set, format, branch, foreach).
  UUID ids. `validateSkill` = hardened static gate (whitelisted ops/fns,
  branch-sound G-17 entityRef + refType, capability closure via `reads`/`writes`,
  requires `confirmationText`, total over arbitrary JSON). `validateType`.
- `router.dart` — corpus fast-path (template→regex→slots), date resolver,
  quantity/text/entity extraction, corpus-learning ratchet **both halves**
  (`learn` guarded; `isLearned`/`forget` = negative half), retrieval fallback.
- `session.dart` — the DispatchOrchestrator turn engine. `handle` catch-all
  boundary; undo→correction→authoring→route→execute→persist→learn. Per-turn clock.
  Execution-journal ring (multi-turn undo). Tracks previous turn (write OR read)
  so corrections target correctly. Emits the **turn log** telemetry.
- `storage_repository.dart` — `StorageRepository` interface + `FileStorageRepository`
  (per-record JSON, stamp-on-change, tombstones, atomic writes, corpus-learned,
  authored defs, turnlog). **Session holds the interface, never touches files.**
- `claude.dart` — `CloudClient` interface + `ClaudeClient` (Haiku residual routing
  + authoring). Never throws (offline/401/timeout/refusal→null). Injectable key+URL.
- `config.dart` — `loadConfig` (dataDir + apiKey from env > `~/.plenara/config.json`
  > scaffolded default) + `ensureSeeded` (copies built-in defs into the user folder).
- `store.dart` (HLC + file fns, wrapped by the repo), `embed.dart`,
  `replay_cloud.dart` (record/replay cassette), `fixture_inputs.dart`.
- `reminders.dart` — the `NotificationScheduler` OS seam + `FakeScheduler` + pure
  derive/reconcile (armed set DERIVED from the record store; idempotent). Session
  reconciles on init + every turn and exposes `pendingNudges()`.

**`v0/data/`** — 8 types, **26 skills**: tasks (create/list/complete/delete/due/**reschedule**),
running (log-run, count-runs-this-week), mood (log/recall), reminders (set/list/
complete/cancel/**reschedule**), people-facts (remember/recall/forget/**remember-relationship**),
interactions (log/last/list), list-relations, birthdays (set/when/upcoming). DSL compute fns: `format_time`,
`next_annual`, `days_until_annual`; conds incl. **`contains`**; the date resolver
handles month-name dates. Helper libs: `dates.dart` (annual math), `people.dart`
(birthday-nudge projection), `reminders.dart` (notification seam + reconcile),
`turnlog.dart` (dogfood metrics).
**`v0/bin/plenara.dart`** — console (REPL / `--demo` / one-shot) over the same Session.
**`app/`** — Flutter Windows chat UI; `buildSession()` from config; 2 widget tests.

**`v0/test/`** (1019): router (453), pipeline/fuzz (265), interpreter (~150),
cloud/cassette (~35), session (~35), robustness (33), store (~20), claude (14),
config (5), hardening (~20).

## Recent arc (what just happened, newest first)

- **Spec-conformance program STARTED (`46d15a5` … `e62bedf`):** ran a 5-fork spec-vs-code
  audit (the ranked top-10 is in the TL;DR + the gap register `05b-gap-register.md`);
  then shipped: journaling (`journal_entry` + log/recall, F-11/G-01), streaks
  (`current_streak`/`longest_streak` + run-streak, G-21), **2 real defects** (safety
  bypass: `_defRe` missed "build me a" so DP-01/DP-08 skipped the §7.6 floor; format
  leaked `{var}` on null — both fixed `c29732c`), and **DSL query+compute fidelity**
  (`8cc36ed`: read_many orderBy/limit + full filter ops; compute sum/avg/min/max/
  count_where/days_between/add_days/if) + total-distance demonstrating it; then item 2
  ProvideSlot (`619f07c`, resumable missing-slot dialogue), item 4 aliases (`f3a396f`,
  "Mum"/"the boss" → contact via a new alias tier in read_one), and the free→paid slice
  of item 3 (`f9e2695`). **Next: item 5 — correction robustness (F-14/F-15).**
- **More depth + real bug fixes (done, `02f4388` … `6a17c15`):** reschedule-reminder
  (snooze) — which exposed and FIXED a `reconcileReminders` time-change bug (armed()
  now returns ref→time so a rescheduled reminder re-arms); reschedule-task;
  remember-relationship (closes the flagship "X is Y's Z" offline gap, found via an
  end-to-end console smoke); a "realistic day" cross-skill integration test; DOGFOOD.md
  refreshed for tonight (25+ skills to try, turnlog_report, ATL→toast→voice plan).
- **Working-mode fix (done, `627d4cc` + user-level hook):** rewrote the "keep going"
  rule to target turn-endings + added a Stop hook that enforces it. See TL;DR.
- **recall-mood + authoring de-flake (done, `c9fb48e`, `88c11c3`):** recall-mood
  ("how have I been feeling"); recorder + schema-drift test now drive the Session
  validate→retry authoring loop so re-records no longer flake on first-attempt
  out-of-vocab fns.
- **Capability depth (done, `b21ff4e` … `c36d00a`):** `due-tasks` ("what's due" /
  "anything overdue" — overdue + today, excluding future/done); `forget-fact`
  ("forget that Mia likes chess") + a new `contains` cond (case-insensitive substring
  in branches); `list-relations` querying the relationship graph BOTH directions
  ("Sarah's daughter: Mia" and "Mia: daughter of Sarah"). People loop is now full CRUD.
- **Phase 2 complete: partial name matching + disambiguation (done, `ec14145`):**
  `read_one` resolves exact-first then substring (opt-in `partial:true` on people READ
  skills); >1 match throws with candidate labels (`ResolveError.options`) which Session
  renders as a "which one?" clarify. Write/find-or-create stay exact (dedup preserved).
- **Phase 2a: discoverability + turnlog report (done, `949f501`):** "what can you do"
  is a Session special-case (no re-record) rendering a capability-grounded, per-skill-
  gated overview; `bin/turnlog_report.dart` + `lib/turnlog.dart` aggregate source
  distribution, cloud health, top skills, and the make-or-break clarify rate.
- **Phase 1: typed CloudResult (done, `072586e`):** `CloudResult` sealed type
  (`CloudOk`/`CloudError` + `CloudErrorKind`) replaces `Map?`/null at the cloud seam;
  `_message` maps every HTTP/parse outcome to a kind (never throws); Session names the
  cause on a cloud-caused miss + logs a `cloud` turnlog field; skill inputs can declare
  `"type": date|datetime` and Session normalizes cloud slots via resolveDate/DateTime;
  dropped the absolute `.env` fallback. Cassette UNCHANGED (recorded values wrap as Ok).
  `claude_test` now asserts a kind per failure; new `cloud_result_test` covers R1+R2.
- **Fable strategic review:** ranked next phases toward v1 — Phase 1 (cloud truth) now
  done; Phase 2 (conversation polish) next; persisted journal explicitly WAIT (Spec 04
  §3.11's undo window is 5 min, so post-restart undo is mostly moot until execution is
  async). Full review reasoning is in the session log.
- **list-interactions + app build verify (done, `e0268ca`, `6cce275`):**
  "what have I logged with X" (dated bullets + notes); grew app widget tests to 8
  (undo, multi-turn, list render, busy state); clarified count-runs-this-week's
  displayName so Haiku stops intermittently abstaining on "since Monday"; confirmed
  `flutter build windows` succeeds.
- **On-open birthday nudges (done, `74ee048`):** "🎂 X's birthday is in N days" on
  launch, derived from contacts (no new skill). Factored annual-date math into
  `lib/dates.dart` (shared by the interpreter + `lib/people.dart`). `pendingNudges()`
  now merges reminder (⏰) + birthday (🎂) nudges. Completes Fable #4.
- **Birthdays (done, `a31eefa`):** DSL `next_annual`/`days_until_annual` compute fns,
  month-name dates in the resolver ("March 3", "3rd of december"), + `set-birthday`
  / `when-birthday` / `upcoming-birthdays` (30-day window via reversed-gte). +6 tests.
  This completes Fable #3 (people loop).
- **People loop pt.1 (done, `bf6cdc4`):** `interaction` type (subject→contact,
  note, at) + `log-interaction` ("talked to/called/caught up with X [about Y]",
  finds-or-creates the contact) + `last-interaction` ("when did I last talk to X",
  MAX date via a foreach+gte/set reduction since the DSL has no sort). +6 tests.
- **Reminder management (done, `0fddb86`):** list / complete / cancel-reminder;
  complete sets `done:true` and cancel deletes → reconcile cancels the toast. +8 tests.
- **F2 reminders + notifications (done, `4d30b68`):** `NotificationScheduler`
  seam (`v0/lib/reminders.dart`) with a `FakeScheduler`; the armed set is DERIVED
  from the record store and reconciled idempotently (on init + every turn), so
  undo/delete/complete cancel toasts for free and re-open never double-arms.
  New `reminder` type + `set-reminder` skill (graceful missing-time clarify),
  corpus templates, `router.resolveDateTime` (a time-of-day is required = the
  task-vs-reminder discriminator), `interpreter.format_time`. App shows past-due
  reminders as on-open nudges. +30 v0 tests + 1 widget. Re-recorded the cloud
  cassette (adding a skill grows invSig). Native Windows toast deferred (ATL).
- **Hermeticity fix (`b6ca68c`):** the authoring path rebuilt the retrieval index
  unconditionally; now it honors `init(retrieval:)` like init does, so authoring
  is hermetic without the embed server (was a 30s timeout on a machine without it).
- **Dogfood enablement (Fable #1, done):** config + first-run seeding (real folder
  + BYOK key), the turn-log measurement instrument, fixed the correction/read-only
  defect Fable found, `DOGFOOD.md`.
- **Track A / foundation (done):** execution-journal ring (multi-turn undo),
  `read_related` (10/10 ops), `StorageRepository` seam, corpus-learning negative half.
- **Two design decisions (Luis's call):** DSL dialect **converge spec↔code** —
  structure from code (`{fn,args}` compute, inline then/else), names/envelope from
  spec (`entityRef`, `confirmationText`, `reads`/`writes`); corpus **single-file for
  v1** (per-device deferred to P2).
- **Fable code review fully implemented (6 waves):** UUID ids, hardened gate,
  never-throw client + timeout + unit tests, per-turn clock, app no-silent-failure,
  CRDT fidelity, framing-keyed safety floor, update/delete ops, encryption-posture
  spec fix, cost-cap flag.

## Next task (build this, test-first)

**Fable #1–#4 DONE; app widget tests grown (8).** Remaining options, roughly by
value/risk (none need Luis):
- **Depth in existing loops (re-record on each new skill):** `list-interactions`
  ("what have I logged with X" — read_related interactions, formatted); tracker
  templates; a "help / what can you do" surface.
- **Persisted undo journal** (Spec 04 §3.11) — undo is in-memory today (dies on
  restart). Contained to `Session` + a device-local journal file (NOT the synced
  records folder). Medium effort; marginal UX value (rare to undo post-restart).
- **Typed `CloudResult`** (offline vs bad-key vs rate-limited) — closes a
  spec-vs-code gap (CLAUDE.md architecture says the client returns typed results,
  not exceptions). HIGHER blast radius: changes the `CloudClient` interface, so it
  ripples through `ReplayCloud`/`RecordingCloud`, every test stub, and `session`.
  Best started fresh, not at the tail of a long session.
- Presentation archetypes stay DEFERRED (Spec 01 §9 unwritten; chat renders fine).

**When you DO add a skill later:** it grows the capability inventory → the cloud
cassette's `invSig` keys change → **re-record** `test/fixtures/cloud.json`
(`dart run bin/record_fixtures.dart`, needs the BYOK key in the rig `.env`).
Routing stayed stable across the re-records this session (one count-runs route
flapped once to abstain, correct on the next roll — Haiku sampling variance);
eyeball the printed routes each time.

**Reminder architecture already in place (reuse it):** `v0/lib/reminders.dart`
holds the `NotificationScheduler` seam + `FakeScheduler` + the pure derive/reconcile
(`desiredArmed`, `dueReminders`, `reconcileReminders`). Session takes an optional
`scheduler`, reconciles on init + every turn, and exposes `pendingNudges()`. The
armed set is derived from records, so any skill that writes/updates/deletes a
`reminder` (typeId `reminder`, `remindAt` datetime, `done` bool) participates for
free — no per-skill notification wiring.

## Fable's ranked next-phase priorities (strategic review)

1. Dogfood enablement — **DONE.**
2. **Reminders + notifications (F2)** — the retention hook (← next).
3. Deepen the people loop — log-interaction, "when did I last talk to X", birthdays.
4. Thin on-open nudge surface (not the full AutomationRunner yet).
5. Presentation archetypes — **defer** (Spec 01 §9 unwritten; chat renders fine; trap now).
6. Tracker templates — defer (spec-completion).
7. CRDT merge engine — **do not build** (hardware-gated, its own assessment defers it).
8. Safety Layers 2/3, spec completeness — archival for an audience of one.

## Deferred / open (don't lose these)

- **Native Windows toast for reminders — BLOCKED on ATL (needs admin).** The real
  `NotificationScheduler` impl (flutter_local_notifications, native C++/WinRT) needs
  the ATL VS component. Dev Mode is on and the plugin symlinks/compiles; it only
  fails on `fatal error C1083: 'atlbase.h'`. Install (ADMIN shell):
  `& 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\setup.exe' modify --installPath 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\BuildTools' --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.ATL --quiet --norestart`
  Then: re-add `flutter_local_notifications`, write the real impl behind the seam,
  inject it in `buildSession()`, `flutter build windows`, smoke a real toast. All
  logic is already tested against `FakeScheduler`; only the render is manual.
- **Cloud residual reminder times** — Haiku may route a reminder-ish utterance to
  set-reminder but its `when` slot isn't run through `resolveDateTime`, so a natural
  time ("tomorrow at 3pm") may not normalize. Corpus path is exact; cloud path for
  reminders is best-effort. Normalize cloud datetime slots in Session as a follow-up.
- **Voice** (STT/TTS) — behind `SpeechInput`/`SpeechOutput` seams; needs Dev Mode + audio hw.
- **iOS build** — Apple hardware.
- **Typed `CloudResult`** — distinguish offline / bad-key / rate-limited (minor UX; deferred).
- **Persisted execution journal** — undo is in-memory (dies on restart); Spec 04 wants persisted.
- **Per-device corpus files** — deferred to P2 (single-file for v1 per Luis).
- **CRDT merge engine** — format is merge-ready; the engine is P2 (needs 2 devices).
- **Cost-cap number** — Spec 03 §7.3 flagged "don't ship 20/hr unchanged"; needs beta data.
- **App widget tests** — thinnest-covered surface; grow these (per directive #1).
- **API key** — pasted in an early session, stored ONLY in gitignored
  `planning/specs/05a-rig/.env`; **MUST be rotated**; never print/commit it.

## Specs / docs map
